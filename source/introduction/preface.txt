Plone is an open source content management system that lets non-technical people 
create and maintain web content from their broswer.  With a rich ecosystem of 
add-on packages and a highly extensible layout system, Plone offers a robust platform
for those wishing to enhance its core functionality.

Plone has a number of strengths:

* Plone enables complex workflows
* Plone has rich support for internationalization
* Plone provides clear upgrade paths
* Plone integrates with Active Directory, Salesforce, LDAP, SQL, Web Services,
  Oracle (By using Add-on products)
* Plone scales well
* Plone will grow with your expanding CMS needs. Many systems will be good
  for simple sites, but will not be able to handle the expanding requirements 
  you are likely to encounter over time.
* Plone is Open Source!

Plone and its accompanying technologies have evolved over the course of many
years. The codebase contains over 6000 modules. Given the complexity of the
overall system and large number of optional and included packages, very few
Plone developers/users know how do everything.

Due to Plone's longevity it has spanned and outlasted some technologies and
Python practices.  Thus you will see some Python usage which may not match
todays accepted code practices. You will also see use of Python libraries 
which are deprecated, and/or implement code where today a standard or 
optional Python package would be preferred.

Due to Plone's complexity it's important to keep the following in mind:

* Plone has a high level of complexity
* Plone has more than one way to accomplish many tasks. (Some of which are deprecated)
* Plone doesn't always have the most complete or up to date documention for all components

When you encounter something you want to get accomplished, but you are unable
to find direct examples of how to do it, use the following procedure:

#. Formulate your question to represent your issue in a way that makes it easy for others to answer [1]_
#. Search via google and/or stackoverflow
#. Try the ``#plone`` IRC channel on freenode [2]_ 
#. Join and send email to the product-developers email list [3]_. 
#. UTSL (Use The Source Luke). Plone is almost entirely Python code. You can always refer to the source to figure out anything about Plone. Plone source is made up of Python, ZCML, XML, Javascript and Page Template files.

If you ask the community for help, it may not arrive instantly. Please remember 
that People are voluntarily helping you. If you need help immediately your best 
option may be to find paid support for your issues [4]_.

Be patient. Be aware that you are dealing with a complex system and you need to
reserve time to manage technology and minimize risks. The community is very supportive and will help you if you make an effort to make it easy for them to do so.

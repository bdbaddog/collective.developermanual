Preface

Plone and its accompanying technologies have evolved over the course of many
years. The codebase contains over 6000 modules. Given the complexity of the
overall system and large number of optional and included packages, very few
Plone developers/users know how do everything.

Due to Plone's longevity it has spanned and outlasted some technologies and
Python practices.  Thus you will see some Python usage which may not match
todays accepted code practices. You will also see use of Python libraries 
which are deprecated, and/or implement code where today a standard or 
optional Python package would be preferred.

Due to Plone's complexity it's important to keep the following in mind:

* Plone has a high level of complexity
* Plone has more than one way to accomplish many tasks. (Some of which are deprecated)
* Plone doesn't always have the most complete or up to date documention for all components

When you encounter something you want to get accomplished, but you are unable
to find direct examples of how to do it, you can resort to the two following
methods:

* Search via google and/or stackoverflow
* Learn how to ask a good question [1]_
* Try the ``#plone`` IRC channel on freenode [2]_ 
* Join and send email to the product-developers email list [3]_. 
* UTSL (Use The Source Luke). Plone is almost entirely Python code. You can always refer to the source to figure out anything about Plone. Plone source is made up of Python, ZCML, XML, Javascript and Page Template files.

If you ask the community for help, it may not arrive instantly. Please remember that People are voluntarily helping you. If you need help immediately your best option may be to find paid support for your issues [4]_.

Be patient. Be aware that you are dealing with a complex system and you need to
reserve time to manage technology and minimize risks. The worst unknowns are
unknowns you don't know are unknowns. But remember: there are never things you
cannot do or things you cannot know. There is no black box |---| the codebase is
all open. With enough patience, you can study it and find solutions to all
problems. If the stock code does not do it, you can easily monkey-patch the
existing modules to bend them to your will, or in the most extreme situations
you can fork the entire project.
